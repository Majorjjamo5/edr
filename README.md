# ED Recon (aka EDR)
EDR is an [EDMC](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/) plugin for [Elite: Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) whose purpose is to warn you about dangerous commanders and help bounty or powerplay hunters to chase them. 

Author: LeKeno from [Cobra Kai](https://inara.cz/wing/2035/).

## Video showcase
See this [short video showcasing some of EDR's features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhWTyeE-s7E)

## Sample screenshot
Here is one of EDR's many commands in action. `!where` shows the last known sighting of an outlaw or enemy player. Note: the layout can be customized.
